# C-like Compiler (C--)

A compiler for a C-like language called C--, implemented in C++. This project currently features a fully functional lexical analyzer (scanner) that tokenizes C-- source code.

## Project Status

*   **Current Phase:** Lexical Analysis (Scanner)
*   **Functionality:** The compiler can take a C-- source file, process it through the lexer, and output a stream of identified tokens with their types, values, line numbers, and column numbers.

## C-- Language Tokens Supported by the Lexer

The lexer currently recognizes the following tokens according to the C-- language specification:

**Keywords:**
*   `int`
*   `void`
*   `if`
*   `else`
*   `while`
*   `return`
*   `input`
*   `output`

**Operators:**
*   `+` (Addition)
*   `-` (Subtraction)
*   `*` (Multiplication)
*   `/` (Division)
*   `=` (Assignment)
*   `==` (Equal to)
*   `!=` (Not equal to)
*   `<` (Less than)
*   `<=` (Less than or equal to)
*   `>` (Greater than)
*   `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

**Delimiters:**
*   `{` (Left Brace)
*   `}` (Right Brace)
*   `(` (Left Parenthesis)
*   `)` (Right Parenthesis)
*   `[` (Left Bracket)
*   `]` (Right Bracket)
*   `;` (Semicolon)
*   `,` (Comma)

**Literals & Identifiers:**
*   **Numbers:** Integer literals (e.g., `123`, `0`, `42`).
*   **Identifiers:** Names for variables and functions (e.g., `myVar`, `calculate`, `x`). Identifiers must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.

**Comments:**
*   Single-line comments starting with `//` are supported and ignored by the lexer.

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the source code for the compiler components.
    *   `Lexer.h`, `Lexer.cpp`: Lexical analyzer implementation.
    *   `Token.h`, `Token.cpp`: Token structure and related utilities.
    *   `main.cpp`: Main driver program.
*   `tests/`: Contains unit tests.
    *   `lexer_tests.cpp`: Unit tests for the lexer.
    *   `sample_programs/`: Directory for example C-- source files.
*   `Makefile`: Automates the build and test process.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Build Instructions

To build the compiler executable:
```bash
make
```
This will create an executable at `build/c-like-compiler`.

## Running the Lexer/Scanner

To process a C-- source file and see the stream of tokens produced by the lexer:

1.  **Save your C-- code:** Create a text file with your C-- program. It's recommended to use the extension `.c--` (e.g., `your_program.c--`).
2.  **Run the compiler:**
    ```bash
    ./build/c-like-compiler path/to/your_program.c--
    ```
    For example, if you have a file named `hello.c--` in the current directory:
    ```bash
    ./build/c-like-compiler hello.c--
    ```
    Or, try using one of the sample programs:
    ```bash
    ./build/c-like-compiler tests/sample_programs/hello.c--
    ```
    The output will be a list of tokens identified from your source file.

## Run Lexer Tests

To run the unit tests for the lexer:
```bash
make test
```

## Clean Build Artifacts

To remove compiled object files and executables:
```bash
make clean
```

## Next Steps

The next major phase in the development of this compiler is the **Parser**. The parser will take the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and verify if they conform to the grammatical rules of the C-- language, typically by building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
